# Cyber-bullying
The use of social media has grown exponentially over time with the growth of the Internet and has
become the most influential networking platform in the 21st century. However, the enhancement
of social connectivity often creates negative impacts on society that contribute to a couple of bad
phenomena such as online abuse, harassment cyberbullying, cybercrime and online trolling.
Cyberbullying frequently leads to serious mental and physical distress, particularly for women and
children, and even sometimes force them to attempt suicide. Online harassment attracts attention
due to its strong negative social impact. Many incidents have recently occurred worldwide due to
online harassment, such as sharing private chats, rumours, and sexual remarks. Therefore, the
identification of bullying text or message on social media has gained a growing amount of attention
among researchers. The purpose of this research is to design and develop an effective technique to
detect online abusive and bullying messages by merging natural language processing and machine
learning. Two distinct freatures, namely Bag-of - Words (BoW) and term frequency-inverse text
frequency (TFIDF), are used to analyse the accuracy level of four distinct machine learning
algorithms.
